<p>We are a group of Anonymous English and Polish coworkers who are watching the tragedy occur in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
Like you, our hearts were broken as we watched the suffering that is being presently inflicted on the Women, Children, and Men of Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
Our diverse group is comprised of a of Software Developers, Project Managers, IT Specialists, and Crypto Currency Enthusiasts. Our mission is simple, every fund that donated to us will be sent to the aid organizations in Poland that will assist with the ongoing humanitarian and refugee crisis in Poland. Our reasons to wish Anonymous are simple, we believe that charity begins with the heart and that virtue signaling is a waste of time. As a result of our wish to remain Anonymous, we foresee the consequences in which comments may come forward suggesting our altruistic actions are either a fraud or scam. We have nothing to prove to you. If you wish to not donate, you don't have to. Every fund donated will be sent forward to charities on the ground including but not limited to: Refugee Centre Linin, The Polish Hospitality Foundation,  <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/">Come Back Alive</a> and <a href="https://armysos.com.ua/en/">Army SOS</a>: both will use donated funds to help purchase supplies for the Ukrainian military, including ammunition, shields, and food.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RazomForUkraine/fundraisers">Razom for Ukraine</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/337101825010055/">Help for Ukraine</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/507886070680475/">Sunflower of Peace</a> , and <a href="https://www.rsukraine.org/">Revived Soldiers Ukraine</a>: these four organizations will use donations to fund medical aid for the people of Ukraine, including the purchase of first aid kits, backpacks stuffed with medical supplies, and medical rehabilitation for injured soldiers.</p>

<p>All of your donations will be anonymous and even the slightest donation will go a far way in helping aid the Ukranians.
